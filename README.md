# Database-Chart-Visualizer
The purpose of of this program is to display data of an animated 'bar format'. Each inputed data will have its own category which is then assigned to its own unique color. When the program is ran, it will display all the data in an animated format.
How to use the program: Inside application.cpp, you first need to choose what file you want to read located in the "Data Charts" folder. By default, the program will have filename = "Data Charts/cities.txt". As the name suggest, it will give you a visual chart of cities. At the bottom of application.cpp you'll see a function "bca.animate(cout, 12, -1);".
The 12 represents how many bars you want to see at a time (12 is the limit), the -1 represents how many frames (-1 is all the frames). Other data files you can test is "Data Charts/brands.txt" and "Data Charts/football.txt". You can even create your own data by following the model of other data.txt files.
